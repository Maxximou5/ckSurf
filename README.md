<p><strong>Updating instructions from 1.19 -> 1.21: a lot of bug fixes, you might need to change skillgroups.cfg and related rank colors again https://github.com/nikooo777/ckSurf/pull/59</br>

If you want to keep your old titles then you'll have to manually copy over the old ones and make <b>SURE</b> that the colors are supported</strong><p>
<p><strong>This fork is probably the most updated version you'll find available, please note that it's compiled against sm-1.8 and only works on sm-1.8+</strong><p>
<p>The original developer(s) quit their work, the latest (Jonitaikaponi) has gone as far as deleting the repo. I (Nikooo777) will try to keep it going</p>
<p>As of today 27th of October 2017 the project is being developed by several other members, and I am accepting all working Pull Requests.</p>
